Hello, why are we using GitHub?
1) Source control so you can track changes
2) Versioning in case you are retarded and mess up the entire code
3) Better for collaboration since many people can work on the same file and we can track what changes you made

What does the lingo mean? This is the main stuff:
- Branches: Alternate versions of the "main" branch, holding zone for new features which may break hte "main" branch
- Pull: Update your local version to match a branch on github
- Push: Update the github branch with your local version
- Merge / Merge request: Merge or create a request to merge a side branch to the "main" branch
- Commit: Save your local version with any changes you made
- Repository: Fancy name for root folder
