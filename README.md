Hello, why are we using GitHub?
1) Source control so you can track changes
2) Versioning in case you are retarded and mess up the entire code
3) Better for collaboration since many people can work on the same file and we can track what changes you made

What does the lingo mean? This is the main stuff:
- Branches: Alternate versions of the "main" branch, holding zone for new features which may break hte "main" branch
- Pull: Update your local version to match a branch on github
- Push: Update the github branch with your local version
- Merge / Merge request: Merge or create a request to merge a side branch to the "main" branch
- Commit: Save your local version with any changes you made
- Repository: Fancy name for root folder

# AI Learning
2) learn about how neural networks work in concept (deep learning)
3) learn about how image classification works in concept (convolutional neural networks (CNNs))
# PyTorch Learning
4) learn how to implement it in pytorch (learn the documentation and learn how to program it)
4a) Learn how to use pytorch datasets & dataloaders 
4b) Learn how to use the torch.nn functions (these are building blocks for neural networks)
4c) Learn how to create a custom CNN using torch.nn.Module
4d) Learn how to create a training loop (Probably have to watch a ytube video)
# Further improvements
5) Research previous models for image classification and how they work (You will have to read research papers)
5a) If something is useful and is backed by strong results in the paper, implement it into your model (If u need help I can help)
6) Learn about regularization techniques (reduction of overfitting), optimization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning (trial and error tuning of hyperparameters to improve model results)
# Final solution
7) Get your dataset, make sure it matches the requirements of how you want your model to perform
8) With your model architecture and dataset, train it on google colab, then download the .pt file
9) Create a program to run your model do geoguessing
